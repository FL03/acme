//! # Core
//!
//! The core module provides the fundamental building blocks for the Acme library.
//! One of the primary focuses of the library is to provide a set of primitives and utilities
//! for interpreting various operations. The core module is the foundation for the rest of the
//! library, and it is designed to be as lightweight as possible.
